# Abstract

Recent studies have indicated that the Hubble tension could be fully resolved in the context of a fundamental physics transition occurring at $z_t\lesssim 0.01$ (less than about 150 million years ago) abruptly increasing the absolute magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae (SnIa) by $\Delta M \simeq 0.2$. Such a transition could have occurred by a sudden increase of the  strength of the gravitational interactions $G_{eff}$ by about $10\%$ after the transition and would have other observable effects in the local universe including a transition in the absolute magnitude of the Cepheid stars that are used as calibrators of SnIa. In the present analysis we search for such a transition in the Cepheid calibration data. Thus, unlike previous studies we do not enforce a universal absolute magnitude for the Cepheid SnIa calibrators. Instead we use the Cepheid data to derive a best fit value of the Cepheid absolute magnitude $M_H^<$ for galaxies with distances below a critical distance $D_c$  and a separate best fit value $M_H^>$ for galaxies with distances above the critical distance. We show that both the Cepheid best fit absolute magnitude and color luminosity parameters indicate the presence of a transition at a critical distance $D_c$ in the range between $8Mpc$ and $18Mpc$ or at a time between $25\,Myrs$ and $55\,Myrs$ ago. For this range of $D_c$ the best fit value of $M_H^<= -5.903\pm 0.042$ differs from the best fit value of $M_H^>=-6.092\pm 0.035$  at a level more that $4\sigma$ with $\Delta M_H\equiv M_H^> - M_H^<=-0.189\pm 0.077$. The magnitude of this transition is consistent with the magnitude required for the resolution of the Hubble tension in the context of a fundamental gravitational transition. The distance range/timescale corresponding to this transition is consistent with a recent analysis indicating a similar transition in the context of the Tully-Fisher data.
